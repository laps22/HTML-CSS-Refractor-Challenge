# Refractor Code Challenge

## Description

For this challenge I will refractor the delivered index so that it displays semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure. Part of this is ensuring that the heading attributes are in sequential order. To adhere to the client request to have an accesible webpage. The image elements will contain accesible attributes. These attributes will allow for search engine optimization as well. Lastly, we will add a descriptive and concise title to the site.

## Help

There is an issue with the aside element and I'm stuck on how to correct it so that the column is inline with the section content. Please advise with any assisted feedback.
